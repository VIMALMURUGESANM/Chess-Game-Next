After reviewing a task assigned by a professional web developer at Zoho, And Sharing my development experience:

Access to Git Repository: [https://github.com/VIMALMURUGESANM/Chess-Game-Next](https://github.com/VIMALMURUGESANM/Chess-Game-Next) ;Contributions Appreciated :) .

The Task:  
Refer - The chess language: [https://lnkd.in/gBXUsWVx](https://lnkd.in/gBXUsWVx)

Create a simple, functional chessboard web application using Javascript, CSS and HTML with the following features:  
‚Ä¢ A chessboard canvas with pieces.  
‚Ä¢ Turn-based movement for players.  
‚Ä¢ Piece movements restricted to chess rules.  
‚Ä¢ Support for advanced moves like en passant and castling.

---

### **Step 1: Basic Chessboard Creation with HTML and CSS**

#### **The Goal:**

Start by creating a visual representation of the chessboard with alternating black and white squares. This step introduces styling and layout fundamentals.

#### **Key Concepts:**

* **HTML Structure:** Use an 8x8 grid of `<div>` elements to represent the chessboard.
    
* **CSS Styling:** Style the board using `flexbox` or `grid`, and apply alternating square colors with `nth-child` selectors.
    

#### **Challenges Addressed:**

1. Creating a responsive layout for the chessboard.
    
2. Ensuring visual clarity with proper dimensions and alignment.
    

---

### **Step 2: Adding Simple Piece Movements with JavaScript**

#### **The Goal:**

Introduce interactivity by allowing pieces to move on the board. At this stage, focus on moving pieces without enforcing chess rules.

#### **Key Concepts:**

* **Event Listeners:** Use `click` events to select and move pieces.
    
* **State Management:** Store the current board state in a 2D array to track the position of each piece.
    
* **Dynamic Updates:** Update the DOM dynamically to reflect piece movement.
    

#### **Challenges Addressed:**

1. Highlighting selected pieces and valid moves.
    
2. Handling user interactions like selecting and placing pieces.
    

---

### **Step 3: Choosing Next.js and Why**

#### **Why Next.js Over Plain HTML/JavaScript?**

While HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can create a basic chess game, Next.js offers significant advantages for scalability and maintainability:

1. **Component-Based Architecture:** Reusable components like `<Square>` and `<Piece>` make the code modular and easy to manage.
    
2. **Modern Development Tools:** Built-in support for TypeScript, hot module replacement (HMR), and linting improves the developer experience.
    
3. **Advanced Features:** Server-side rendering (SSR) and API routes enable features like saving game progress, implementing leaderboards, or adding AI opponents.
    

---

### **Step 4: Implementing Valid Moves and Turn-Based Logic**

#### **The Goal:**

Add logic to enforce valid chess moves and switch turns between players.

#### **Key Concepts:**

* **Move Validation:** Use chess rules to determine valid moves for each piece (e.g., pawns move forward, knights move in an L-shape).
    
* **Turn-Based System:** Alternate turns between "white" and "black" players after each valid move.
    
* **Error Handling:** Prevent invalid moves and provide visual feedback.
    

#### **Challenges Addressed:**

1. Translating chess rules into code for each piece.
    
2. Updating the game state dynamically after every move.
    

---

### **Step 5: Enhancing the UI with Drag-and-Drop**

#### **The Goal:**

Improve the user experience by allowing players to drag pieces instead of clicking to move them.

#### **Key Concepts:**

* **HTML Drag-and-Drop API:** Implement drag-and-drop functionality for moving chess pieces.
    
* **Feedback and Highlights:** Highlight valid moves when a piece is selected.
    
* **Event Handling:** Use `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop` events to handle piece movement.
    

#### **Challenges Addressed:**

1. Ensuring smooth drag-and-drop interactions across devices.
    
2. Maintaining the state of the board during drag-and-drop operations.
    

---

### **Step 6: Detecting Check and Checkmate**

#### **The Goal:**

Introduce logic to detect check and checkmate conditions to determine when the game ends.

#### **Key Concepts:**

* **Check Detection:** Verify if the king is under threat after each move.
    
* **Checkmate Logic:** Identify if the player in check has any valid moves left.
    
* **Game Over State:** Display a message declaring the winner when checkmate occurs.
    

#### **Challenges Addressed:**

1. Ensuring accurate detection of check and checkmate scenarios.
    
2. Handling edge cases like stalemates or draws.
    

---

### **Step 7: The King gets killed Bug or the ‚ÄúPin Rule‚Äù**

**The Goal:**

Introduce logic to detect whether The King is Pinned by an Opponent piece.

#### **Key Concepts:**

* **Pin Detection**: Disabling the moves of the piece between the King and the Opponent piece ensuring the piece cannot be moved.
    
* **Capture**: Capturing the Attacking Piece.
    

#### **Challenges Addressed:**

1. Ensuring the Piece between the King and the Opponent piece stays intact without any moves.
    
2. The Logic behind the certain move(s) of a piece which unchecks the King.
    

---

### **Step 8: The ‚ÄúCastling‚Äú Rule**

**The Goal:**

Introduce logic which enables the King and the nearest Bishop if none of them moved(Castling).

#### **Key Concepts:**

* Keep track whether the King or Bishop is moved using `getKingMoves`, `getCastlingMoves`.
    
* Check whether the specific square is under attack using `isSquareUnderAttack`.
    
* Check whether King is under check `isCheck`.

#### **Challenges Addressed:**

1. Castling even after King or Bishop is moved.
    
2. Only Short Castling is implemented for now ; will update in this blog.
